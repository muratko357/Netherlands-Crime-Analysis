# The Distribution of Violent and Sexual Crime by Municipality and Neighborhood: The Netherlands and Amsterdam 2018

The study conducts an exploratory analysis on Violent and Sexual Crime-VSC in the Netherlands, at two levels, namely across 380 municipalities of [the country](https://github.com/muratko357/Netherlands-Crime-Analysis/blob/main/NL_Crime_rates_by_municipality.ipynb) and across neighborhoods of [the Amsterdam city](https://github.com/muratko357/Netherlands-Crime-Analysis/blob/main/Crime_by_neighborhood_Amsterdam.ipynb). The analysis reveals the top municipalities with the highest VSC rates per 1000 inhabitants as well as the top neighborhoods with the highest number of police records of VSC in Amsterdam. In each level, the study has produced a static choropleth map and an interactive version of it based on the data analysis. While the static maps display the administrative boundaries of the places and their colors representing their crime density, the interactive maps additionally display names of these places and numbers associated with the VSC when one moves the mouse across one of these maps.

The data used in this study is sourced from the *Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek* (The Hague / Heerlen) under the name of "Registered crimes: districts and neighborhoods 2018 and can be accessed from https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84468NED/table.
