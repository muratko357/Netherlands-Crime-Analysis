# Netherlands Crime Analysis: Violent and Sexual Crime 2018

The study conducts an exploratory analysis on Violent and Sexual Crime rates-VSC (per 1000 inhabitants) by municipality in the Netherlands. The data is sourced from the *Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek* (The Hague / Heerlen) under the name of "Registered crimes: districts and neighborhoods 2018 and can be accessed from https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84468NED/table.

The study produces a table for the top municipalities with the highest VSC rates per 1000 inhabitants of each municipality and generates a static choropleth map of the Netherlands as well as an interactive version of the map based on the calculation of the crime rates. While both maps display the boundaries of municipilaties and their colors indicating their crime rates, the interactive map displays municipalities and their individual crime rates when one moves the mouse on the map.
